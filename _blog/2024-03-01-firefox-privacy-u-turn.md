description: "Firefox’s privacy promise faces scrutiny as Mozilla updates its terms, introduces AI features, and expands data collection. Is your browser still protecting your data, or selling your trust?"

# Introduction
For years, Firefox has been the go-to browser for people who care about protecting their privacy online, instead of going to places like Google Chrome.  
Mozilla, the non-profit organization behind Firefox, built a reputation around the idea of keeping the users data in their hands and their hands only.  
However, recent changes to its terms of service have raised concerns about whether Firefox is still fighting for privacy to be in the power of the users.

# What Changed?
Mozilla removed maybe their most important question from their FAQ, where they had said previously stated that it never sells user data, "Never have, never will".  
Which evidently turned out to be a lie.  

**Red meaning they removed this from their FAQ**

At the same time, they have updated terms of service now grant Mozilla a "**royalty-free, worldwide license**" to user data for "operational purposes".  
But my question with this is, if Firefox was able to function perfectly before as a reliable browser without this information, then why would they need this now. AI, the answer nowadays is always AI.  

For them to make a promise that they never will sell our user data, to then immediately backpedal off of that agreement when its convenient to them is a complete betrayal of user trust, and brings into question what their bottom line is as a "Non-Profit".  
The wording of this update is vague, leading us to question what exactly Mozilla intends to do with this data in the future. Will it just be used for AI or will they dig themselves deeper and sell our data to advertisers as well?  

Another major change is the introduction of AI-powered features, such as AI-enhanced search and assistance tools. Because of course it is.  
While some of these features were made intending to make the user’s searching experience faster and more effective, it always comes at the cost of increased data collection. Seeing as there are a lot of instances of that feature working poorly as well, is it really worth it?

**Google's Terrible "AI Overview" Feature**  

Mozilla has hinted that some level of user data processing is necessary for these AI features to work effectively, which only further removes privacy to your data from your hands.  
As AI continues to progress with these big tech companies incorporating it into everything they do, one issue I don't see talked about enough is how this affects our privacy.

# Mozilla’s Response
Mozilla has defended these changes, arguing that the updated terms are necessary for maintaining and improving browser functionality.  
But this obviously begs the question, if they weren't doing it before, why would they start now.  

The organization has emphasized that it does not sell user data but acknowledges that data collection is essential for AI integration and other operational needs.  
But what is the need to incorporate AI into every little aspect of our life now?  

Despite these assurances, the wording in the new terms remains a point of concern.  
Privacy advocates fear that Mozilla’s shift could be the start of a broader trend toward data collection and monetization.

# What Should You Do?
- **Review your privacy settings:** Disable telemetry and other data-sharing options.  
- **Alternative Browsers:** If you’re unsure about these changes, switching browser might be the best bet for you.  
  [SomeOrdinaryGamer’s video](https://youtu.be/32BKHhSV3II?t=625) on the issue talks about other alternatives that ARE privacy-friendly that you can use.  
- **Keep Up To Date:** I'd recommend keeping an eye on Mozilla’s policies and future updates to see what direction they choose to go in, in the future.
