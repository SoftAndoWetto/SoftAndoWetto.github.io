# Context & Participants

This interview was a shorter, pre-screening interview on my side to see if this is somewhere I want to work.  

The recruiter didn't provide much detail about the role, so they asked what I already knew about the company.  

I explained that I had researched the company beforehand to familiarise myself with what they do.
