# Company 4 Part 2

I was asked in for a second interview with company 2, this one was in person in London

While there office was quite hidden (Thats just because of London's layout), the inside was very nice

<br>

They had about 4 levels and technically the office was for 2 different branches of the company but I was allowed to see all of it

They has hot seats, so where you logged in from to do your work didnt matter and 3 of the stories had the computers

The computer area weren’t at all like what I imagened an office to be like with grey, depressing cubicles

<br>

[INSERT PIC FROM THE INCREDIBLES]

<br>

The bottom floor was more of a nice common area with sofas to hang out on and a lunch area which is provided by the company

They had these "pods" which were completely sound proof for things like taking calls, and you can just use them whever you needed (granted no one was already in there)

<br>

I had 2 people interview me again for this one, one person was a nice HR lady and the other was in charge of IT,

They each asked me questions, firstly were more technical with questions that immediately put me in the spot of the role such as:

- Identifying and securing endpoints
- Implementing security features both locally and remotely (since they have offices all over the world)
- Risk response strategies (Mitigation, Avoidance, Transference, Acceptance)

<br>

Then the HR questions were more along the lines of:

- Security policies (BYOD, using websites that arent work related like shopping)
  - Being friendly and non adversarial but also having a set line between looking at amazon vs downloading movies off of a sketch website for example


- What happens if an employee accidentally downloads a virus
  - Go to management immediately and tell them what happened
  - Ask (not comfront) the employee on what happened to lead up to this (what they were doing)
  - Telling them why this is an issue while not berating them
  - Overall just finding a balance between being strict on policy so nothing occurs while not being overbearring on employees


- If an employee is being unsafe in thei cyber hygiene (both by accident or deliberate)

<br>

I think the main question I asked was the classic:

"In your opinion, what does a high performer in this job role look like?"

<br>

And the answer I got was something to the effect of:

Someone who knows our security posture inside out,

Who has read and knows all of the documentation

for people to be able to approach them about any security question related to the company and have them be able to answer it
