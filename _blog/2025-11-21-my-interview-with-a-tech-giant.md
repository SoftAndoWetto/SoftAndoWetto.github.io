# Company 4

This company is a much bigger one that the other 3 I've talked about, they have offices globally and with that (ofc) comes additional skills that they are looking for

My initial interview was with 2 men, each from America so the interview occured around 4:00 PM GMT, and also lasted about half an hour

1 of them men was the Vice President of the companies IT sector and the other one was the Director of Information Technology

For this interview, as well as asking me technical job related questions and scenarios, they also asked me for my opinions on the current cybersecurity climate

More speciifcally, since I'm British they wanted to know more about the Online Saftey Act that has recently passed and what potential issues I felt like the mightr come from it

- What it is
- The trade offs between security and privacy
- Opinions on government over reach
- The fact its being handles by third parties
- The potential of data breaches

<br>

And then for the technical questions they were more centered around scenarios like:
- Familiarity with Cyber Secuirity Frameworks
- Legal knowledge pertaining to cybersecurity (eg: GDPR, PCI-DSS, etc)
- Being able to explain technical concepts in laymans terms
- BYOD

# Misc Points
They also noted that, even though the connection dropped off a bit, which is understandable considering the distance between us.  

My wearing a suit and turning on my camera, despite it being a virtual interview, didnt go unoticed.  

They did talk about previous experiences with interviewing people.  

They said that to them it shows that when people dont turn on their camera or dont dress at least some-whjat professionally.  

That gives off a sense of being unbothered, which puts them off.

I have to say, though, one thing thats quite funny but definately notable is that being interviewed by an American is notably differnt that being interviewed by a Brit.

- Theyre more casual
- They speak a lot more
- The interview felt more like a conversation at a networking event than an interview

<br>

Now this could just be these two guys in particular but that was what I felt personally from the interview.
