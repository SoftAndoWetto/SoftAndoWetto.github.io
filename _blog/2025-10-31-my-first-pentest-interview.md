# Quick Intro (from me)

I’m interviewing for cyber positions as an Analyst and Pentester, and I figured I’d share some of the notes I’ve taken from my interviews.  

Since I already take notes, to go over after and improve my interviewing ability (because you really do have to practice)

I figured why not also add them to my blog so you can can also learn from my experiences and also hopefully get that job you want

I feel like going over my notes on all my previous interviews definately improved my technique a lot faster than if I didnt.

A lot of the interviews were technical (Problem-solving, Scenarios, and “think on your feet” questions) which really tested what I’ve been learning in labs and personal projects.  

I also always tried to have good questions prepared for the interviewer since they always say at the end if I had any questions for them, and you can't say no to that because the interview is as much for you as it is for the employer.

Hopefully reading my notes will help you guys with interviews you guys may have in the future.

# Introduction

My interview at **Company 1** was for a Penetration Tester position.

Since it was for a high-level role, the focus of the interview was very technical.

The position was full-time from 9–5:30, and they asked if I would be able to balance this with my studies (which I am).

This shows that recruiters do take this into account, whether you are a student or not.

However, recruiters can sometimes overemphasize this, even though it usually isn’t a dealbreaker.

We also discussed the hybrid work model and commuting to their offices two days per week.

# Technical & Behavioral Questions

They started by asking about my certifications, both what I currently possess and any that I am working towards.

This was only a brief talking point, as they were much more interested in my practical skills and knowledge, which made up most of the interview.

They asked me to explain Penetration Testing and the difference between it and a Vulnerability Assessment.

From there, they moved into Penetration Testing concepts such as:

- Social Engineering
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Privilege Escalation
- The phases of a penetration test

They also asked how my peers would describe me as a person, particularly in relation to how I work, my work ethic, and my collaborative ability.

# Next Steps in the Process

They said that I would hear back from them for the second-stage interview.

This will be a simple CTF-style test with three flags that I will be expected to complete, followed by a short report.

The results will then go back to the hiring manager, and finally to the Talent Acquisition team.
