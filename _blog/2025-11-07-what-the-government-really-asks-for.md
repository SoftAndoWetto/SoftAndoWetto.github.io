# Pre-Interview Notes (From Recruiter)

This role was recommended by a recruiter. It is a **government-focused position** for national defence purposes, with a specialization in **5G and 6G applications and security**.

The position is **hands-on**, as I would be experimenting with and securing new technologies, effectively handling advanced tools before they are deployed.
 
<br>

# What They’re Looking For
For this position, the team is seeking someone who:  

- Is genuinely **passionate about vulnerability research**, with a willingness to learn telecoms, recognizing this is a very niche and specialized area.  
- Has **previous hands-on security experience** to demonstrate both commitment and the ability to learn new things.  
- Shows **strong motivation for national security**, which is logical given the government focus.  
- Can **stay current** with developments in the cybersecurity field.  
- Has an interest in **cutting-edge technology**.  

<br>

# How to Demonstrate Fit
- Be prepared to discuss **previous practical experience** in cybersecurity, even if it isn’t directly related to telecoms or 5G/6G security.  
- Show that you are **constantly learning and upskilling**, which demonstrates both passion and commitment.  
- Whenever possible, have something **tangible to show** your work — for example:  
  - Code samples  
  - CTF writeups  
  - Exploit research or vulnerability reports  

<br>

# High Performer in the Role
- Focus on **growth and learning**, not just output.  
- The team functions like a **research lab**, valuing depth of understanding over speed.  
- Key traits for success:  
  - Desire to **learn and specialize** in a particular domain  
  - Ability to **focus deeply** and become an expert  
- **Output is secondary**; results naturally follow expertise.  
- For associates, the emphasis is on **learning and skill-building**.  

<br>

# Biggest Challenges the Team Faces
- **Enabler work tasks**: foundational but necessary to support research.  
- Challenges in **infrastructure development**:  
  - No prior research or tools exist for some aspects of Talecode or 5G.  
  - Teething issues are expected when creating new tools and infrastructure.  
  - **Fuzzing over the air with 5G** is largely uncharted.  
- Building **systems and solutions that haven’t existed before**.  

<br>

# Best Part of Working in Government Cybersecurity
- Less focus on **productivity metrics**, more on **depth and quality** of results.  
- Projects allow for **long-term investigations**, targeting critical vulnerabilities.  
- Success is measured by **one or two high-impact outcomes per project**, rather than many smaller outputs.  

<br>

# Challenges for New Consultants (First 6–12 Months)
- Learning **Talecode**, a highly specialized skill not taught at university.  
- Getting **up to speed in a new domain** (e.g., 5G, advanced cybersecurity concepts).  
- Adapting to **pioneering research** and working with unfamiliar tools.
