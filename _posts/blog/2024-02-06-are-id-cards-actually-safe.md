# Introduction  
You probably work for a company or go to a school that uses something like a key fob or an ID card in order to enter the building, but how secure are they really?  

During my first semester at university, I decided to test this and see how far I could get without using my ID card at all.  

<br>

⚠️ **Disclaimer**: Everywhere I went, I had explicit permission to do so and could access the buildings via conventional means with my ID card. This was done as a controlled experiment to test security awareness, not to break rules.  

<br><br>

# The 100% Success Rate at the General Entrance  
The general entrance was always the busiest, making it the easiest place to walk in unnoticed.  

- I could simply enter alongside a group of people.  
- Nobody questioned me when I followed others inside.  
- Once inside, I could access corridors, classrooms, and other blocks (STEM, Business, IT, etc).  

**Result:** 15/15 successful entries.  

<br><br>

# What Happened at the Specific Entrance?  
At one specific entrance, I still had a **100% success rate** — but there was one notable interaction.  

- Once, when I needed to re-enter and nobody else was around, I knocked.  
- Reception opened the door for me without hesitation.  
- A passerby (not staff) asked if I was a student. I said *yes* and claimed I had lost my card.  

That was enough. No verification was performed.  

**Result:** 31/31 successful entries.  

<br><br>

# Classrooms  
Later in the semester, I became curious about how easy it would be to get **room availability information** without an ID.  

- At the main reception, I asked about a room’s timetable.  
- When asked for my ID number, I said I didn’t have it.  
- When asked to check my email, I claimed my authenticator wasn’t working.  
- Despite this, I was still given the information with little suspicion.  

Staff mentioned it might take longer to check, but they still provided the details.  

<br><br>

# The Library — The Only Failure  
Unlike other areas, the library had **proper access control** in place:  

1. To enter, you must swipe your ID at a **turnstile** (1-to-1 entry).  
2. Following directly behind someone is nearly impossible.  
3. The librarian’s desk faces the entrance, making piggybacking obvious.  

Both the main and downstairs entrances enforced this system.  

**Result:** Entry impossible without an ID card.  

<br><br>

# So What Does This Mean?  
The main takeaway is that **access without an ID card is far too easy** in most parts of the university.  

- Tailgating was highly effective.  
- Reception staff rarely enforced strict verification.  
- The only effective access control existed at the library.  

This inconsistency highlights a serious **security risk**. If someone with malicious intent exploited these weaknesses, they could access classrooms, offices, or other sensitive areas with little resistance.  

<br><br>

# Recommendations  

### Universities should:  
- Enforce stricter verification at receptions.  
- Train staff to **challenge those without ID**.  
- Educate students about the risks of tailgating.  

### Students should:  
- Avoid letting strangers piggyback in behind them.  
- Report suspicious behaviour at entry points.  
- Recognise that security controls exist for a reason.  

<br><br>

# End  
This experiment showed that while **ID cards can work**, they are only as effective as the people and systems enforcing their use.  

Until stricter measures are put in place, tailgating remains a trivial way to bypass security.
