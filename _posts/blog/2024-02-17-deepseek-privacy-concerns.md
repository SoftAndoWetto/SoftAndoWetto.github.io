The Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot and alternative to ChatGPT, DeepSeek, has found itself at the centre of controversy due to concerns over its data privacy practices. David Bombal has conducted a thorough analysis that has raised serious questions about the platform’s handling of user data.

# David Bombal’s Alarming Findings
Using Wireshark, David Bombal tracked the network traffic of his phone while using DeepSeek. Despite the company’s claims of not transmitting data to China, Bombal’s test revealed that 51 data packets were being sent directly to Beijing, raising serious doubts about DeepSeek’s data management practices.  

Further analysis uncovered that the data was routed through Alibaba Cloud, adding fuel to the growing concerns. DeepSeek’s privacy policy had clearly stated that the service did not share user data with third-party entities outside of specified purposes and with how the legal system works in china, data is granted to the government upon immediate request regardless of reason (as far as my knowledge and research has led me to believe).  

The revelation has sparked widespread debate about the platform’s commitment to user privacy. As Bombal pointed out in his video, DeepSeek's privacy statements do not align with the test results, creating a disconnect between the company's official policies and its actual practices.

# So What's Going On In South Korea?
Just days later, South Korea has taken measures in response to the privacy concerns surrounding DeepSeek. On February 15, 2025, the country’s 

Personal Information Protection Commission (PIPC) suspended all new downloads of the AI chatbot. According to them, DeepSeek had failed to comply with South Korea’s Personal Information Protection Act. The commission’s investigation revealed serious shortcomings in how the chatbot processed personal data and facilitating third party communication.  

The suspension comes after independent analysis conducted by the PIPC, which found that DeepSeek’s data handling practices weren't good enough for national privacy regulations. They noted, the company had not taken adequate steps to address the potential risks associated with its data collection practices when the service was launched.  

While the web service remains accessible, the download suspension has stopped new users from accessing the app. Existing users have been advised to use the app with caution, particularly in not entering personal information.

# Going Forward
DeepSeek is not alone in facing scrutiny over data privacy, with concerns that AI platforms, especially from China, may exploit personal data for commercial or political gain.  

While some view data sent to China as a byproduct of DeepSeek’s origin, others see it as part of broader transparency issues in the AI industry.  

The international community is calling for stronger privacy regulations and watching how companies respond.
