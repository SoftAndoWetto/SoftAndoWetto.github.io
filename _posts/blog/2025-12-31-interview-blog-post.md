# Introduction

_Note: For privacy and professionalism, no company names or people will be mentioned._

The purpose of these notes is not to analyse or critique the companies or interviewers, but to focus on the **interview process and the types of questions asked**.

The goal is to provide a clear, honest reflection of the experience — what topics were covered, how the discussion flowed, and what skills or qualities seemed to matter most.

My aim is to share the experiences I’ve had in interviews to help anyone preparing for a cybersecurity role, such as:

- Topics discussed
- Key points
- Skills and qualities employers look for

These notes serve both as a record of my preparation and as a resource for others approaching similar interviews in the cybersecurity field.


# Company 1

## Introduction

My interview at **Company 1** was for a Penetration Tester position.

Since it was for a high-level role, the focus of the interview was very technical.

The position was full-time from 9–5:30, and they asked if I would be able to balance this with my studies (which I am).

This shows that recruiters do take this into account, whether you are a student or not.

However, recruiters can sometimes overemphasize this, even though it usually isn’t a dealbreaker.

We also discussed the hybrid work model and commuting to their offices two days per week.

<br>

## Technical & Behavioral Questions

They started by asking about my certifications — both what I currently possess and any that I am working towards.

This was only a brief talking point, as they were much more interested in my practical skills and knowledge, which made up most of the interview.

They asked me to explain Penetration Testing and the difference between it and a Vulnerability Assessment.

From there, they moved into Penetration Testing concepts such as:

- Social Engineering
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Privilege Escalation
- The phases of a penetration test

They also asked how my peers would describe me as a person, particularly in relation to how I work, my work ethic, and my collaborative ability.

<br>

## Next Steps in the Process

They said that I would hear back from them for the second-stage interview.

This will be a simple CTF-style test with three flags that I will be expected to complete, followed by a short report.

The results will then go back to the hiring manager, and finally to the Talent Acquisition team.

<br>

## Key Takeaways About the Role

- In this client-facing role, **the consultant is the product** — professionalism and presence are critical.
- Consistently delivering **high-quality, polished work** is expected.
- **Proactiveness, responsiveness, and engagement** are highly valued.
- Client interaction is constant; confidence and competence are essential.

<br>

## Anticipated Challenges for New Starters

- Adapting to a **new and evolving offensive security service**.
- Navigating **large-scale organizational processes**.
- Becoming **client-ready quickly**, as performance is highly visible.

# Company 2

## Pre-Interview Notes (From Recruiter)

This role was recommended by a recruiter. It is a **government-focused position** for national defence purposes, with a specialization in **5G and 6G applications and security**.

The position is **hands-on**, as I would be experimenting with and securing new technologies, effectively handling advanced tools before they are deployed.

<br>

## What They’re Looking For
For this position, the team is seeking someone who:  

- Is genuinely **passionate about vulnerability research**, with a willingness to learn telecoms, recognizing this is a very niche and specialized area.  
- Has **previous hands-on security experience** to demonstrate both commitment and the ability to learn new things.  
- Shows **strong motivation for national security**, which is logical given the government focus.  
- Can **stay current** with developments in the cybersecurity field.  
- Has an interest in **cutting-edge technology**.  

<br>

## How to Demonstrate Fit
- Be prepared to discuss **previous practical experience** in cybersecurity, even if it isn’t directly related to telecoms or 5G/6G security.  
- Show that you are **constantly learning and upskilling**, which demonstrates both passion and commitment.  
- Whenever possible, have something **tangible to show** your work — for example:  
  - Code samples  
  - CTF writeups  
  - Exploit research or vulnerability reports  

<br>

## High Performer in the Role
- Focus on **growth and learning**, not just output.  
- The team functions like a **research lab**, valuing depth of understanding over speed.  
- Key traits for success:  
  - Desire to **learn and specialize** in a particular domain  
  - Ability to **focus deeply** and become an expert  
- **Output is secondary**; results naturally follow expertise.  
- For associates, the emphasis is on **learning and skill-building**.  

<br>

## Biggest Challenges the Team Faces
- **Enabler work tasks**: foundational but necessary to support research.  
- Challenges in **infrastructure development**:  
  - No prior research or tools exist for some aspects of Talecode or 5G.  
  - Teething issues are expected when creating new tools and infrastructure.  
  - **Fuzzing over the air with 5G** is largely uncharted.  
- Building **systems and solutions that haven’t existed before**.  

<br>

## Best Part of Working in Government Cybersecurity
- Less focus on **productivity metrics**, more on **depth and quality** of results.  
- Projects allow for **long-term investigations**, targeting critical vulnerabilities.  
- Success is measured by **one or two high-impact outcomes per project**, rather than many smaller outputs.  

<br>

## Challenges for New Consultants (First 6–12 Months)
- Learning **Talecode**, a highly specialized skill not taught at university.  
- Getting **up to speed in a new domain** (e.g., 5G, advanced cybersecurity concepts).  
- Adapting to **pioneering research** and working with unfamiliar tools.  

<br><br>

# Company 3

## Context & Participants

This interview was a shorter, pre-screening interview on my side to see if this is somewhere I want to work.  

The recruiter didn't provide much detail about the role, so they asked what I already knew about the company.  

I explained that I had researched the company beforehand to familiarise myself with what they do.

<br>

## Company & Role Overview

The company develops, releases, and supports software for both public and private sectors, serving a variety of industries.

<br>

## What the Company Is Looking For

The company is seeking a candidate with strong security knowledge beyond what the current IT team possesses, while also being able to learn their specific tech stack.
